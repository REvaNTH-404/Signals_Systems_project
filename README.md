# Signal Processing GUI Project

This project is a Python application that allows users to:
- Select a signal type (sine, square, sawtooth, etc.)
- Choose a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, scaling, differentiation, integration, etc.)
- Visualize the original and processed signals using a graphical interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- NumPy (signal operations)
- Matplotlib (plotting)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Features
- User-friendly GUI for signal selection and operation
- Real-time plotting of signals
- Extensible for more signal types and operations
